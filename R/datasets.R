#'
#' The network consists of 321917 emails sent between employees of Enron between
#' 1999 and 2003. Nodes in the network are individual employees and edges are
#' individual emails.  Edges are directed and weighted. The direction is from
#' the sender to the receiver and the weight represents the number of messages.
#' It is possible to send an email to oneself, and thus this network contains
#' loops.

#' Florentine families
#'
#' Network data of Florentine families, in \code{igraph} format.
#'
#' A list containing two networks and a data.frame with attributes.
#'
#' This is a data set of marriage and business ties among Renaissance Florentine
#' families. The data is originally from Padgett (1994) via UCINET and stored
#' as an \code{igraph} object.
#'
#' This dataset is a subset of the original data and contains data on sixteen
#' families.
#'
#' The two relations are business ties (\code{flobusiness}, recorded financial
#' ties such as loans, credits and joint partnerships) and
#' marriage alliances (\code{flomarriage}).
#'
#' In addition, there is a data.frame with attributes:
#' \itemize{
#' \item wealth each family's net wealth in 1427 (in thousands of lira)
#' \item priorates the number of priorates (seats on the civic council) held
#' between 1282- 1344
#' \item totalties the total number of business or marriage ties in the total
#' dataset of 116 families.
#' }
#'
#' The data are symmetrically coded. This makes sense for marital ties,
#' but is unfortunate for the financial ties (which are almost certainly
#' directed in real life).
#'
#' Substantively, the data include families who were engaged in a struggle
#' for political control of the city of Florence in around 1430.
#' Two factions were dominant in this struggle: one revolved around the
#' infamous Medicis (9), the other around the powerful Strozzis (15).

#' Sampson monastary network data
#'
#' Multiplex, multitime network Of Positive Affection Within A Monastery
#'
#' This is a version of the well-known Sampson Monastery network.
#'
#' Sampson recorded the social interactions among a group of monks while resident
#' as an experimenter on vision, and collected numerous sociometric rankings.
#' During his stay, a political "crisis in the cloister" resulted in the expulsion
#' of four monks (Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18) and the voluntary departure of several
#' others - most immediately, Nos. 1, 7, 14, 15, and 16. (In the end, only
#' 5, 6, 9, and 11 remained).
#'
#' Most of the present data are retrospective, collected after the breakup
#' occurred. They concern a period during which a new cohort entered the
#' monastery near the end of the study but before the major conflict began.
#' The exceptions are "liking" data gathered at three times: SAMPLK1 to SAMPLK3 -
#' that reflect changes in group sentiment over time (SAMPLK3 was collected in
#' the same wave as the data described below). Information about the senior
#' monks was not included.
#'
#' Four relations are coded, with separate matrices for positive and negative
#' ties on the relation. Each member ranked only his top three choices on that
#' tie. The relations are esteem (SAMPES) and disesteem (SAMPDES), liking
#' (SAMPLK) and disliking (SAMPDLK), positive influence (SAMPIN) and negative
#' influence (SAMPNIN), praise (SAMPPR) and blame (SAMPNPR). In all rankings
#' 3 indicates the highest or first choice and 1 the last choice. (Some subjects
#' offered tied ranks for their top four choices)
#'
#' Overall, the data concern ten valued networks of 18 vertices.

#' twitter network
#'
#' twitter network
#'
#' twitter network, in \code{igraph}-format. The network is known as "icwsm_polarization"
#'
#' The official documentation:
#'
#' Overview
#'
#' This dataset describes three networks of political communication between
#' users of the Twitter social media platform in the six weeks prior to the 2010
#' Congressional midterm elections. This network is particularly interesting
#' because one mode of communication, retweets, segregates users into two
#' politically homogeneous communities of likeminded individuals, while mentions
#' form a bridge between the two communities over which users are exposed to
#' people and information they would not likely select ahead of time.
#'
#' Data Source
#'
#' The present analysis leverages data collected from the Twitter ‘gardenhose’
#' API (dev.twitter.com/pages/ streaming_api) between September 14th and
#' November 1st, 2010 — the run-up to the November 4th U.S. congressional
#' midterm elections. During the six weeks of data collection we observed
#' approximately 355 million tweets.
#'
#' Identifying Political Content
#'
#' Let us define a political communication as any tweet containing at least one
#' politically relevant hashtag. To identify an appropriate set of political
#' hashtags and to avoid intro- ducing bias into the sample, we performed a
#' simple tag co-occurrence discovery procedure. We began by seeding our sample
#' with the two most popular political hashtags, #p2 (“Progressives 2.0”) and
#' #tcot (“Top Conservatives on Twitter”). For each seed we identified the set
#' of hashtags with which it co-occurred in at least one tweet, and ranked the
#' results using the Jaccard coefficient. Thus, when the tweets in which both
#' seed and hashtag occur make up a large portion of the tweets in which either
#' occurs, the two are deemed to be related.
#'
#' Political Communication Networks
#'
#' From the tweets containing any of the politically relevant hashtags we
#' constructed networks representing political communication among Twitter
#' users. Focusing on the two primary modes of public user-user interaction,
#' mentions and retweets, we define communication links in the following ways.
#' In the retweet network an edge runs from a node representing user A to a node
#' representing user B if B retweets content originally broadcast by A,
#' indicating that information has propagated from A to B. In the mention
#' network an edge runs from A to B if A mentions B in a tweet, indicating that
#' information may have propagated from A to B (a tweet mentioning B is visible
#' in B’s timeline). Both networks therefore represent potential pathways for
#' information to flow between users.
#'
#' The retweet network consists of 23,766 non-isolated nodes among a total of
#' 45,365. The largest connected component accounts for 18,470 nodes, with 102
#' nodes in the next-largest component. The mention network is smaller,
#' consisting of 10,142 non-isolated nodes out of 17,752 total. It has 7,175
#' nodes in its largest connected component, and 119 in the next-largest.
#' Because of their dominance we focus on the largest connected components for
#' the rest of our analysis.
